<h1 align=center>PerlGuts Illustrated<br><small>Version 0.03</small></h1>

<p>This document is meant to supplement the <i>perlguts(1)</i> manual
page that comes with Perl.  It includes commented illustrations of all
(eventually?) major internal Perl data structures.  Having this
document handy hopefully makes reading the Perl source code easier.
It might also help you interpret the <i>Devel::Peek</i> variable
dumps.  I'll try to expand it as I learn more.

<p>The first things to look at are the data structures that represent
Perl data; scalars of various kinds, arrays and hashes.  Internally
Perl calls a scalar <i>SV</i> (scalar value), an array <i>AV</i>
(array value) and a hash <i>HV</i> (hash value).  In addition it uses
<i>IV</i> for integer value, <i>NV</i> for numeric value (aka double),
<i>PV</i> for a pointer value (aka string value (char*), but 'S' was
already taken), and <i>RV</i> for reference value.  The <i>IVs</i> are
further guaranteed to be big enough to hold a <code>void*</code>.

<p>The internal relationship between the Perl data types is really
object oriented.  Perl relies on using C's structural equivalence to
help emulate something like C++ inheritance of types.  The various
data types that Perl implement are illustrated in this class hierarchy
diagram.  The arrows indicate inheritance.

<p><center><img src="types.gif"></center>

<p>As you can see, Perl uses multiple inheritance with C <i>SvNULL</i> (also named just <i>SV</i>)
acting as some kind of virtual base class.  All the Perl types are
identified by small numbers, and the internal Perl code often gets away
with testing the ISA-relationship between types with the <= operator.
As you can see from the figure above, this can only work reliably for
some comparisons.  All Perl data value objects are tagged with their
type, so you can always ask an object what its type is and act
according to this information.

<p>The symbolic type names (and associated value) are:

<blockquote><dl>
	<dt>0) <b>SVt_NULL</b>
	<dt>1) <b>SVt_IV</b>
	<dt>2) <b>SVt_NV</b>
	<dt>3) <b>SVt_RV</b>
	<dt>4) <b>SVt_PV</b>
	<dt>5) <b>SVt_PVIV</b>
	<dt>6) <b>SVt_PVNV</b>
	<dt>7) <b>SVt_PVMG</b>
	<dt>8) <b>SVt_PVBM</b>
	<dt>9) <b>SVt_PVLV</b>
	<dt>10) <b>SVt_PVAV</b>
	<dt>11) <b>SVt_PVHV</b>
	<dt>12) <b>SVt_PVCV</b>
	<dt>13) <b>SVt_PVGV</b>
	<dt>14) <b>SVt_PVFM</b>
	<dt>15) <b>SVt_PVIO</b>
</dl></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the simple type names already mentioned, the
following names are found in the figure: An <i>SvPVIV</i> value can
hold a string and an integer value.  An <i>SvPVNV</i> value can hold a
string, an integer and a double value.  The <i>SvPVMG</i> is used when
magic is attached or the value is blessed.  The <i>SvPVBM</i> adds
information for fast searching (Boyer-Moore) on the string value.  The
<i>SvPVLV</i> represents a l-value object (the result of substr).
<i>CV</i> is a code value, which represents a perl
function/subroutine/closure or contains a pointer to an XSUB.
<i>GV</i> is a glob value and <i>IO</i> contains pointers to open
files and directories and other state information about files.  The
<i>SvPVFM</i> is used to hold information on forms.

<p>A Perl data object can change type as the value changes.  The SV is
said to be upgraded in this case.  Type changes only go down the
hierarchy.  (See the sv_upgrade() function in sv.c.)

<p>The actual layout in memory does not really match how a typical C++
compiler would implement a hierarchy like the one depicted above.
Let's see how it is done.

<blockquote><small><i>

In the description below we use field names that match the macros that
are used to access the corresponding field.  For instance the
<code>xpv_cur</code> field of the <code>xpvXX</code> structs are
accessed with the <code>SvCUR()</code> macro.  The field is referred
to as <b>CUR</b> in the description below.  This also match the field
names reported by the <i>Devel::Peek</i> module.

</i></small></blockquote>

<h2>SvNULL and struct sv</h2>

<p>The simplest type is SvNULL.  It always represents an
<i>undefined</i> scalar value.  It consist of the "struct sv" only,
and looks like this:

<p><center><img src="svnull.gif"></center>

<p>It contains a pointer (ANY) to more data, which in this case is
always NULL.  All the subtypes are implemented by attaching
additional data to the ANY pointer.

<p>The second field is an integer reference counter (REFCNT) which should
tell us how many pointers reference this object.  When Perl data types
are created this value is initialized to 1.  The field must be
incremented when a new pointer is made to point to it and decremented
when the pointer is destroyed or assigned a different value.  When the
reference count reaches zero the object is freed.

<p>The third field contains some FLAGS and a TYPE sub-field.

<p>The type field contains a code that represents one of the types
shown in the type hierarchy figure above. 

<p>The SV contains 24 flag bits. The flags bits contain information on how
the fields of the object should be interpreted, and
other state information.  Some flags are just used as optimizations
in order to avoid having to dereference several levels of pointers
just to find that the information is not there.

<p><center><img src="flags.gif" alt=""></center>

<p>The purpose of the flag bits are:

<blockquote>
<dl>

  <dt> 0) <b>PADBUSY</b>

  <dd> reserved for tmp or my already
       <p>

  <dt> 1) <b>PADTMP</b>

  <dd> in use as tmp
       <p>

  <dt> 2) <b>PADMY</b>

  <dd> in use a "my" variable
       <p>

  <dt> 3) <b>TEMP</b>

  <dd> string is stealable
       <p>

  <dt> 4) <b>OBJECT</b>

  <dd> This flag is set when the object is "blessed".  It can only be
       set for value type SvPVMG or subtypes of it.  This flag also
       indicates that the STASH pointer is valid and 
       points to a namespace HV.
       <p>

  <dt> 5) <b>GMAGICAL</b> (Get Magic)

  <dd> This flag indicates that the object has a magic <i>get</i> or
       <i>len</i> method to  be invoked.
       It can only be set for value type SvPVMG or subtypes
       of it.  This flag also indicate that the MAGIC pointer is valid.

       <p>

  <dt> 6) <b>SMAGICAL</b> (Set Magic)

  <dd> This flag indicates that the object has a magic <i>set</i> method to
       be invoked.
       <p>

  <dt> 7) <b>RMAGICAL</b> (Random Magic)

  <dd> This flag indicates that the object has any other magical methods
       (besides get/len/set magic method) or even methodless magic attached.
       <p>
       Any of GMAGICAL, SMAGICAL and RMAGICAL is called MAGICAL
       <p>

  <dt> 8) <b>IOK</b> (Integer OK)

  <dd> This flag indicates that the object has a valid IVX field value.
       It can only be set for value type SvIV or subtypes of it.
       <p>

  <dt> 9) <b>NOK</b> (Numeric OK)

  <dd> This flag indicates that the object has a valid NVX field value.
       It can only be set for value type SvNV or subtypes of it.
       <p>


  <dt> 10) <b>POK</b> (Pointer OK)

  <dd> This flag indicates that the object has a valid PVX, CUR and LEN
       field values (i.e. a valid string value).
       It can only be set for value type SvPV or subtypes of it.
       <p>

  <dt> 11) <b>ROK</b> (Reference OK)

  <dd>  This flag indicates that the type should be treated as an SvRV
        and that the RV field contains a valid reference pointer.
       <p>

  <dt> 12) <b>FAKE</b>

  <dd>glob or lexical is just a copy
       <p>

  <dt> 13) <b>OOK</b>  (Offset OK)

  <dd> This flag indicates that the IVX value is to be interpreted as
       a string offset.  This flag can only be set for value type SvPVIV
       or subtypes of it.  It also follows that the IOK (and IOKp) flag must
       be off when OOK is on.  Take a look at the <i>SvOOK</i> figure
       below.
       <p>

  <dt> 14) <b>BREAK</b>

  <dd>refcnt is artificially low
       <p>

  <dt> 15) <b>READONLY</b>

  <dd> This flag indicate that the value of the object may not be
       modified.
       <p>


  <dt> 16) <b>IOKp</b> (Integer OK Private)

  <dd>has valid non-public integer value
       <p>

  <dt> 17) <b>NOKp</b> (Numeric OK Private)

  <dd>has valid non-public numeric value
       <p>

  <dt> 18) <b>POKp</b> (Pointer OK Private)

  <dd>has valid non-public pointer value

</blockquote>

<p>The <code>struct sv</code> is common for all subtypes of SvNULL in
Perl.  In the Perl source code this structure is typedefed to
<i>SV</i>, <i>AV</i>, <i>HV</i>, <i>CV</i>, <i>GV</i> and <i>IO</i>.
Routines that can take any type as parameter will have
<code>SV*</code> as parameter.  Routines that only work with arrays or
hashes have <code>AV*</code> or <code>HV*</code> respectively in their
parameter list.

<h2>SvPV</h2>

<p>A scalar that can hold a string value is called an <i>SvPV</i>.  In
addition to the <i>SV</i> struct of SvNULL, an <i>xpv</i> struct is
allocated and it contains 3 fields.  PVX is the pointer to an
allocated char array.  CUR is an integer giving the current length of
the string.  LEN is an integer giving the length of the allocated
string.  The char/byte at (PVX + CUR) should always be '\0' in order
to make sure that the string is NUL-terminated if passed to C library
routines.  This requires that LEN is always at least 1 larger than CUR.

<p><center><img src="svpv.gif"></center>

<p>The POK flag indicates that the string pointed to by PVX contains
an valid string value.  If the POK flag is off and the ROK flag is
turned on, then the PVX field is used as a pointer to an SV (see SvRV
below) and CUR/LEN is unused.  A SvPV with both POK and ROK flags
turned off represents <i>undef</i>.  The PVX pointer can also be NULL
when POK is off and no string storage has been allocated.

<h2>SvPVIV and SvPVNV</h2>

<p>The <i>SvPVIV</i> type is like <i>SvPV</i> but has an additional
field to hold a single integer value called IVX.  The IOK flag
indicates if the IVX value is valid.  If both the IOK and POK flag is
on, then the PVX will (usually) be a string representation of the same
number found in IVX.

<p><center><img src="svpviv.gif"></center>

<p>The <i>SvPVNV</i> type is like <i>SvPVIV</i> but has an additional
field to hold a single <i>double</i> value called NVX.  The
corresponding flag is called NOK.

<p><center><img src="svpvnv.gif"></center>

<h2>SvOOK</h2>

As a special hack in order to improve the speed of removing characters
from the beginning of a string, the OOK flag is used.  When this flag
is on, then the IVX value is not interpreted as an integer value, but
is instead used as an <i>offset</i> into the string.  The PVX, CUR,
LEN is adjusted to point within the allocated string instead.  The
sv_chop()/sv_backoff() routines adjust the offset.

<p><center><img src="ook.gif"></center>

<h2>SvIV and SvNV</h2>

<p>As a special case we also have <i>SvIV</i> and <i>SvNV</i> types
that only have room for a single integer or a single double value.
These are special in that the PVX/CUR/LEN fields are not present even
if the ANY pointer actually points to the ghostual incarnation of
them.  This arrangement makes it possible for code to always access
the IVX/NVX fields at a fixed offset from where the SV field ANY
points.

<p><center><img src="sviv.gif"></center>

<p><center><img src="svnv.gif"></center>

<h2>SvRV</h2>

<p>The <i>SvRV</i> subtype just lets the SV field ANY point to a
pointer which points to an SV (which can be any of the SvNULL
subtypes).  A SvRV object with ROK flag off represents an undefined
value.

<p><center><img src="svrv.gif"></center>

<p>Subclasses of SvPV can also be treated as SvRV objects when the ROK
flag is turned on for them.  The PVX will then be used as the RV field
of the SvRV.

<p><center><img src="svpvrv.gif"></center>

<h2>SvPVMG</h2>

<p>The <i>SvPVMG</i> is like <i>SvPVNV</i> above, but has two
additional fields; MAGIC and STASH.  MAGIC is a pointer to additional
structures that contains callback functions and other data.  If the
MAGIC pointer is non-NULL, then one or more of the MAGICAL flags will
be set.

<p>STASH (<b>s</b>ymbol <b>t</b>able h<b>ash</b>) is a pointer to a
HV that represents some namespace/class, which means that the NAME
field of the HV must be non-NULL (see description of HV below).  The
STASH field is set when the value is blessed into a package (becomes
an object).  The OBJECT flag will be set when STASH is.

<p><center><img src="svpvmg.gif"></center>

<p>The field MAGIC points to an instance of <code>struct magic</code>
(typedefed as <code>MAGIC</code>).  This struct has 8 fields:
<ol>

<li>
<i>moremagic</i> is a pointer to another MAGIC and is used to form a
single linked list of the MAGICs attached to an SV.

<li><i>virtual</i> is a pointer to a struct containing 5 function
pointers.  The functions (if set) are invoked when the corresponding
action happens to the SV.

<li><i>private</i> is a 16 bit number (U16) not used by Perl.

<li><i>type</i> is a character field and is used to denote which kind
of magic this is.  The interpretation of the rest of the fields depend
on the <i>type</i> (actually it is the callbacks attached to
<i>virtual</i> that do any interpretation).  There is usually a direct
correspondence between the <i>type</i> field and the <i>virtual</i>
field.

<li><i>flags</i> contains 8 flag bits.  Only 2 are generally used.
Bit 1 is the <b>REFCOUNTED</b> flag.  It indicates that the <i>obj</i>
is assumed to be an SV and that it's reference count must be
decremented when this magic is freed.  The <b>GSKIP</b> flag indicate
that invocation of the magical GET method should be suppressed.  Other
flag bits are used depending of the kind of magic.

<li><i>obj</i> is usually a pointer to some SV.  How it is used
depends on the kind of magic this is.

<li><i>ptr</i> is usually a pointer to some character string.  How it
is used depends on the kind of magic this is.  If the <i>len</i> field
is >= 0, then <i>ptr</i> is assumed to point to a malloced buffer and
will be automatically freed when the magic is.

<li><i>len</i> is usually the length of the character string pointed
to by <i>ptr</i>.  How it is used depends on the kind of magic this
is.

</ol>


<h2>SvPVBM</h2>

<p>The <i>SvPVMG</i> is like <i>SvPVMG</i> above, but has three
additional fields; BmUSEFUL, BmPREVIOUS, BmRARE.  The SvPVBM value
types are used internally to implement very fast lookup of the string
in PVX using the Boyer-Moore algorithm.  They are used by the Perl
index() builtin when the search string is a constant, as well as in
the RE engine.  The fbm_compile() function turns normal SvPVs into
this value type.

<p>A table of 256 elements is appended to the PVX.  This table
contains the distance from the end of string of the last occurrence of
each character in the original string. (In recent Perls, the table is
not built for strings shorter than 3 character.)  In addition
fbm_compile() locates the rarest character in the string (using
builtin letter frequency tables) and stores this character in the
BmRARE field.  The BmPREVIOUS field is set to the location of the
first occurrence of the rare character. BmUSEFUL is incremented
(decremented) by the RE engine when this constant substring (does not)
help in optimizing RE engine access away.  If it goes below 0, then
the corresponding substring is forgotten and freed;

<p><center><img src="svpvbm.gif"></center>

<p>The extra SvPVMG information and the character distance table is
only valid when the <b>VALID</b> flag is on.  A magic structure with
the sole purpose of turning off the VALID flag on assignment, is always
attached to a <i>valid</i> SvPVMG.

<p>The <b>TAIL</b> flag is used to indicate that the search for the SvPVMG
should be <i>tail anchored</i>, i.e. a match should only be considered
at the end of the string (or before newline at the end of the string).


<h2>SvPVLV</h2>

The <i>SvPVLV</i> is like <i>SvPVMG</i> above, but has four additional
fields; TARGOFF, TARGLEN, TARG, TYPE.  The typical use is for Perl
builtins that can be used in the L-value context (substr, vec,...).
They will return a SvPVLV value, which when assigned to affect the
<i>target</i> object which we keep a pointer to in the TARG field.

<p>The TYPE is a character variable.  It encodes the kind if L-value
this is.  Interpretation of the other L-value fields depend on the TYPE.
The SvPVLVs are (almost) always magical.  The magic type will match
the TYPE field of the SvPVLV.  The types are:


<blockquote><dl compact>

<dt> <b>'x'</b>

<dd> Type-x LVs are returned by the <code>substr($string,
$offset, $len)</code> builtin.

<dt> <b>'v'</b>

<dd> Type-v LVs are returned by the <code>vec($string,
$offset, $bits)</code> builtin.

<dt> <b>'.'</b>

<dd> Type-. LVs are returned by the <code>pos($scalar)</code> builtin.

<dt> <b>'k'</b>

<dd> Type-k LVs are returned when <code>keys %hash</code> is
used on the left side of the assignment operator.

<dt> <b>'y'</b>

<dd> Type-y LVs are used by auto-vivification (of hash and array
elements) and the foreach array iterator variable.

<dt> <b>'/'</b>

<dd> Used by <i>pp_pushre</i>.  I don't understand this yet.

</dl></blockquote>

<p>The figure below shows a SvPVLV as returned from the
<code>substr()</code> builtin.  The first substr parameter (the
string to be affected) is assigned to the TARG field.  The substr
offset value goes in the TARGOFF field and the substr length parameter
goes in the TARGLEN field.

<p><center><img src="svpvlv.gif"></center>

<p>When assignment to an SvPVLV type occurs, then the value to be
assigned is first copied into the SvPVLV itself (and affects the PVX,
IVX or NVX). After this the magic SET method is invoked, which will
update the TARG accordingly.


<h2>AV</h2>

<p>An array is in many ways represented similar to strings.  An AV
contains all the fields of SvPVMG and adds the following tree fields:
ALLOC is a pointer to the allocated array.  ARYLEN is a pointer to an
SV (which is returned when <code>$#array</code> is requested). FLAGS
contains some extra flag bits that are specific of the array subtype.

<p>The first three fields of xpvav have been renamed even though they
serve nearly the same function.  PVX has become ARRAY.  CUR has become
FILL and LEN has become MAX.  One difference is that the value of
FILL/MAX is always one less than CUR/LEN would be in the same
situation.  The IVX/NVX fields are unused.

<p><center><img src="av.gif"></center>

<p>The array pointed to by ARRAY contains pointers to any of the
SvNULL subtypes.  Usually ALLOC and ARRAY both point to the start of
the allocated array.  The use of two pointers is similar to the OOK
hack described above.  The shift operation can be implemented
efficiently by just adjusting the ARRAY pointer (and FILL/MAX).
Similarly, the pop just involves decrementing the FILL count.

<p>The are only 3 array flags used: (I'll try to describe them when I
understand the issue)

<blockquote><dl>

  <dt> 0) <b>REAL</b>
  <dt> 1) <b>REIFY</b>
  <dt> 2) <b>REUSED</b>

</dl></blockquote>

<h2>HV</h2>

<p>Hashes are the most complex of the Perl data types.  In addition to
what we have seen above, HVs use <i>HE</i> structs to represent a
key/value pairs and <i>HEK</i> structs to represent keys.

<p>The HV type itself contains all the fields of SvPVMG and then adds
four new fields:

<ul>
<li>The first two fields are used to implement a single iterator over the
elements in the hash.
RITER which is an integer index into the array referenced by ARRAY and
EITER which is a pointer to an HE.  In order find the next hash
element one would first look at EITER->next and if it turns out to be
NULL, RITER is incremented until ARRAY[RITER] is non-NULL.  The
iterator starts out with RITER = -1 and EITER = NULL.

<li>The last two fields are only used when the hash represents a name
space (<i>stash</i>).  PMROOT points to a node in the Perl syntax
tree.  It is used to implement the require function.  NAME is a
NUL-terminated string which denotes the name of the name space (or
<i>package</i>).  This is one of the few places where Perl does not
allow strings with embedded NULs.
</ul>

<p>As for AVs the first few fields of the xpvhv have been renamed in
the same way.  MAX is the number of elements in ARRAY minus one. (The
size of the ARRAY is required to be a power of 2, since the code that
deals with hashes just mask off the last few bits of the HASH value to
locate the correct HE column for a key: <code>ARRAY[HASH & MAX]</code>).  Also note
that ARRAY can be NULL when the hash is empty (but the MAX value will
still be at least 7, which is the minimum value assigned by Perl.)

The FILL is the number of elements in ARRAY which is not NULL.  The
IVX field has been renamed KEYS and is the number of hash elements in
the HASH.  The NVX field is unused.

<p>The HEs are simple structs containing 3 pointers.  A pointer to the
next HE, a pointer to the key and a pointer to the value of the given hash
element.

<p>The HEKs are special variable sized structures that store the hash
keys.  They contain 3 fields.  The <i>hash</i> value of the string,
the <i>len</i>gth of the string, and the <i>len</i>+1 bytes for the
key string itself.  (As a special case, a <i>len</i> value of
<code>HEf_SVKEY</code> (-2) indicate that a pointer to an SV is stored
in the HEK instead of a string.  This hack is used for some magical hashes.)

<p><center><img src="hv.gif"></center>

<p>In a perfect hash both KEYS and FILL are the same value.  This
means than all HEs can be located directly in the ARRAY (and all the
he->next pointers are NULL).

<p>The following two hash specific flags are found among the common
SvNULL flags:

<blockquote><dl>

  <dt> 21) <b>SHAREKEYS</b>

  <dd> When this flag is set, then all HEK structures containing the
       same strings will be shared between hashes.  This should reduce
       the storage occupied by hash keys.
       The SHAREKEYS flag is on by default for newly created HVs.
       <p>
       <center><img src="strtab.gif"></center>

       <p>
       The shared HEKs are stored in a special HV called
       <code>strtab</code>.  What is special here is that the <i>val</i>
       field of the HE structs is used as a reference counter for the
       HEK.  The counter is incremented when new hashes link up this HEK
       and decremented when the key is removed from the hashes.
       When the reference count reach 0, the HEK (and corresponding HE)
       is removed from <code>strtab</code> and the storage is freed.

       <p>

  <dt> 22) <b>LAZYDEL</b>

  <dd>This flag indicates that the hash element pointed to by EITER is
      really deleted.  When you delete the current hash element, perl
      only marks the HV with the LAZYDEL flag, and when the iterator
      is advanced, then the element is zapped.  This makes it possible
      to delete elements in a hash while iterating over it.
      <p>
