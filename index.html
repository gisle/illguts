<h1 align=center>PerlGuts Illustrated</h1>

This document is meant to supplement the perlguts(1) manual page that
comes with Perl.  It includes commented illustrations of all major
internal Perl data structures.  I'll try to expand it as I learn more.

<p>The first thing to look at are the data structures that represents
Perl data; scalars of various kinds, arrays and hashes.  Internally
Perl calls a scalar <i>SV</i> (scalar value), an array <i>AV</i>
(array value) and a hash <i>HV</i> (hash value).  In addition it uses
<i>IV</i> for integer value, <i>NV</i> for numeric value (double),
<i>PV</i> for a pointer (string, but 'S' was taken) value (char*), and
<i>RV</i> for reference value.

<p>The internal structure of the Perl data types is really object
oriented.  Perl relies on using C's structural equivalence to help
emulate C++ inheritance of types.  The various data types that Perl
implement are illustrated in this class hierarchy diagram.  The arrows
indicate inheritance.

<p><center><img src="types.gif"></center>

<p>As you can see Perl use multiple inheritance with C <i>SvNULL</i>
acting as some kind of virtual base class.  All the Perl types are
identified by numberes, and a lot of the internal Perl code test the
isa-relationship between types with the <= operator.  As you can see
from the figure above, this can only work reliably for some
comparisons.  All Perl data values are tagged with their type, so you
can always ask an object what it's type is and act according to this
information.


<p>An SvPVIV value can hold a string and an integer value.  An SvPVNV
value can hold a string, an integer and a double value.  The SvPVMG is
used when magic is attacted or the value is blessed.  The SvPVBM adds
information for fast searching (Boyer-Moore) on the string value.  The
SvPVLV is a left-side value (the result of substr).  AV, HV has been
mentioned.  CV is a code value, which represents a perl
function/subroutine or cointains a pointer to an XSUB.  GV is a glob
value and IO is contains pointers to open files and directories and
other state information about files.  The SvPVFM is used to hold
information on forms.

<p>Perl data objects can change type as the value change.  The SVs is
said to be upgraded.  Type changes only go down the hierarchy.  (See
the sv_upgrade() function.)

<p>The actual layout in memory does not really match how a typical C++
compiler would implement a hierarcy as the one above.  Let's see how
it is done.

<h2>SvNULL and struct sv</h2>

<p>The simplest type is SvNULL (the type constant is SVt_NULL in the
Perl source code, but I have abrivated the type names somewhat).  It
always represents an <i>undefined</i> scalar value.  It only consist
of the "struct sv" which looks like this:

<p><center><img src="svnull.gif"></center>

<p>It contains a pointer (ANY) to more data, which in this case is
always NULL.  All the subtypes are implemented by attatching
additional data to the ANY pointer.

The second field is an integer reference counter (REFCNT) which should
tell us how many pointers reference this object.  When type objects
are created this value is initialized to 1.  The field must be
incremented when a new pointer is pointing at it and decremented when
the pointer is destroyed or assigned a different value.  When the
reference count reach zero the object is freed.

An finally it contains some FLAGS and a TYPE field.  This structure is
common for all subtypes of SvNULL in Perl.

In the Perl source code this structure is typedefed to <i>SV</i>,
<i>AV</i>, <i>HV</i> and others.  Routines that can take any type as
parameter will have <i>SV*</i> as parameter.  Routines that only work
with arrays or hashes have <i>AV*</i> or <i>HV*</i> in their parameter
list.

<p>The type field contains a code that represents one of the types
shown in the figure above.  The symbolic names (and sequence) is:

<blockquote><pre>
typedef enum {
	SVt_NULL,	/* 0 */
	SVt_IV,		/* 1 */
	SVt_NV,		/* 2 */
	SVt_RV,		/* 3 */
	SVt_PV,		/* 4 */
	SVt_PVIV,	/* 5 */
	SVt_PVNV,	/* 6 */
	SVt_PVMG,	/* 7 */
	SVt_PVBM,	/* 8 */
	SVt_PVLV,	/* 9 */
	SVt_PVAV,	/* 10 */
	SVt_PVHV,	/* 11 */
	SVt_PVCV,	/* 12 */
	SVt_PVGV,	/* 13 */
	SVt_PVFM,	/* 14 */
	SVt_PVIO	/* 15 */
} svtype;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The flags ...............

<h2>SvPV</h2>

<p>A scalar that can hold a string value is called an <i>SvPV</i>.  In
addition to the <i>SV</i> stuct of SvNULL, an <i>xpv</i> struct is
allocated and it contains 3 fields.  PVX is the pointer to an
allocated char array.  CUR is an integer giving the current length of
the string.  LEN is an integer giving the length of the allocated
string.  The char/byte at (PVX + CUR) should always be '\0' in order
to make sure that the string is NUL-terminated if passed to C library
routines.  This requires that LEN is always at lest 1 larger than CUR.

<p>The POK flag indicates if the string pointed to by PVX contains an
valid value.  A SvPV with the POK flag turned off represents
<i>undef</i>.  The PVX pointer can also become NULL when POK is off.

<h2>SvPVIV and SvPVNV</h2>

<p>The <i>SvPVIV</i> type is like <i>SvPV</i> but has an additional
field to hold a single integer value called IVX.  The IOK flag
indicates if the IVX value is valid.  If both the IOK and POK flag is
on, then the PVS will (usually) be a string representation of the same
number found in IVX.

<p>The <i>SvPVNV</i> type is like <i>SvPVIV</i> but has an additional
field to hold a single <i>double</i> value called NVX.  The
corresponding flag is called NOK.

<p><center><img src="svpvnv.gif"></center>

<h2>SvOOK</h2>

As a special hack in order to improve the speed of removing characters
from the beginning of a string, the OOK flag is used.  When this flag
is on, then the IVX value is not intepreted as an integer, but is
instead used as an offset into the string.  The PVX, CUR, LEN is
adjusted to point within the allocated string instead.  The sv_chop()
routine does this.

<p><center><img src="ook.gif"></center>

<h2>SvIV and SvNV</h2>

<p>As a special case we also have <i>SvIV</i> and <i>SvNV</i> types
that only have room for a single integer or a single double value.
These are special in that the PVX/CUR/LEN fields are not present even
if the ANY pointer points to them.  This makes it possible to for code
to always access the IVX/NVX fields at a fixed offset from where SV
field ANY points.

<p><center><img src="svnv.gif"></center>

<h2>SvRV</h2>

<p>The <i>SvRV</i> subtype just lets the SV field ANY point to a
pointer which points to an SV (which can be any of the subtypes
above and below).

<p><center><img src="svrv.gif"></center>

<h2>SvMG</h2>

<p>The <i>SvPVMG</i> is like <i>SvPVNV</i> above, but has two
additional fields; MAGIC and STASH.  MAGIC is a pointer to additional
stuctures that contains callback functions and other data.  STASH is a
pointer to the HV that represents some namespace.  This field is set
when the value is blessed into a package (becomes an object).
